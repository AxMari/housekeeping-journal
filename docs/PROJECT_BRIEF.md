# Project Brief: Housekeeping Journal

## üéØ Project Vision
**Smart, Auto-Scheduling Housekeeping Calendar**

I want to create an intelligent housekeeping calendar that automatically schedules and manages household tasks. Unlike manual task managers, this system will:

- **Auto-schedule tasks** based on frequency and user preferences
- **Dynamically update** when users modify task frequencies or reschedule
- **Provide multiple calendar views** (day, weekend, week, month, year)
- **Include both common and custom tasks** with easy management
- **Plan for AI assistance** to provide housekeeping advice
- **Accommodate professional services** (housekeepers, plumbers, etc.)

**Unique Value:** Intelligent automation that adapts to user behavior while maintaining flexibility for custom needs and professional services.
