# Shared Utilities

This directory contains shared code, types, and utilities that are used across both frontend and backend.

## Purpose

- **Type Definitions**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
- **Constants**: Application-wide constants and configurations
- **Utilities**: Common utility functions
- **Validation Schemas**: Shared validation rules
